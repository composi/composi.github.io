  <h1>3 String Banjo</h1>
  <p>
    Some years back I had a bad accident, breaking both thumbs and index fingers. This left me unable to do many things, like handling buttons, forks, spoons, cups and glasses, etc. Of course I counld play any instruments any more. 20 years past. Now I have reasonable use of my hands, but certain positions can be very unconfortable.
  </p>
  <p>I wanted to play banjo again, but my left hand could support holding the neck with my thumb and reaching over to the third and fourth strings. I could  not manage that. So I had a 3 string banjo made. I first it had a diatonic fretboard. This is what's commonly called a dulcijo. It's basically a stick dulcimer with a banjo head. Mine had a tunable 10" hand drum for the resonator. After a couple of months of getting my hands and fingers used to fretting, sliding, etc. I got pretty bored with the limitations of the diatonic scale. So I had it upgraded to fully chromatic. At the same time I had a 3 string cigar box guitar, chromatic of course. So my banjo was now equivalent to it. I usually use an open chord tuning. DAD, GDG, AEA, etc. Sometimes I use other tunings as well, such as DAC, DAG, EAD, AEC.</p>

      <p>I used a mandolin tailpiece to make it look fancy. That was only $9. Notice the armrest. It's made of persimon wood, as is the bridge, so very hard. The pot is a 10" hand drum off of Amazon (Rhythm Band Tunable Hand Drum 10 in, Rb1180). The armrest keeps my arm off the head while playing, which caused it to sound dull. Now it sings when I play.</p>

      <p>The headstock, like the neck, is red oak. The tuners are closed.</p>

      <p>The neck extends through the hand drum and has blocks of wood at each end to strenthen it.</p>
