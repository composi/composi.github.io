  <h1>3 String Banjo</h1>
  <p>
    Some years back I had a bad accident, breaking both thumbs and index fingers. This left me unable to do many things, like handling buttons, forks, spoons, cups and glasses, etc. Of course I counld play any instruments any more. 20 years past. Now I have reasonable use of my hands, but certain positions can be very unconfortable.
  </p>
  <p>I wanted to play banjo again, but my left hand could support holding the neck with my thumb and reaching over to the third and fourth strings. I could  not manage that. So I had a 3 string banjo made. I first it had a diatonic fretboard. This is what's commonly called a dulcijo. It's basically a stick dulcimer with a banjo head. Mine had a tunable 10" hand drum for the resonator. After a couple of months of getting my hands and fingers used to fretting, sliding, etc. I got pretty bored with the limitations of the diatonic scale. So I had it upgraded to fully chromatic. At the same time I had a 3 string cigar box guitar, chromatic of course. So my banjo was now equivalent to it. I usually use an open chord tuning. DAD, GDG, AEA, etc. Sometimes I use other tunings as well, such as DAC, DAG, EAD, AEC.</p>
