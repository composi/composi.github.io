Composi
========

Composi is a framework for creating desktop and mobile apps. With Composi you can create a dynamic website with reactive components, a progressive web app, or a hybrid app for mobile app stores.

Composi is small. The core is only 2KB gzipped. It therefore loads fast. Its virtual DOM updates components efficiently and quickly. 

You can create functional components, which are pure functions. Or you can create class components that can have local state or use separate dataStores for state management.

By default Composi supports using JSX to define the markup a component will render. If you want, you can also use Composi's `h` function to define the markup, although this will result is more verbose and deeply nested functions.
